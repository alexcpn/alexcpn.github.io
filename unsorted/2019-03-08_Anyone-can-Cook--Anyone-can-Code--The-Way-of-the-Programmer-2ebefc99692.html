I do my work with its help, firing tens or sometimes even hundreds of search queries in a day. You can call me a-Google search Programmer/or a Stack Overflow programmer- but I don’t mean it the way to copy answers naively, post silly questions, get away with doing the bare minimum. No, I code with the help of the internet, and I try help it be a better helper- in small way’s, I add to the knowledge base via articles, answers, blogs, so that it becomes a little easier for someone else to follow. Nothing illustrates it better than sites like StackOverflow — the question-answer format that is much easier to follow than language manuals. But it does not limit itself with Q&amp;A, a little of Quora, tutorials from blogging platforms, helpful Gists, GitHub everything; even maybe this article.</p><p name="7cea" id="7cea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am not ashamed to say that I develop/program with the help of sites like StackOverflow and other articles and blogs and gist and code that come up during Google searches.

To begin with, we need to have the correct idea/spirit of work. We need to define what work is; work is something that makes you sweat — literally or metaphorically- work is something that is really tough, challenging.

One of my favourite pass time is to clean; I used to do it as a kid, I do it now, making endless small changes -I have always felt that cleaning and organizing your house or table or something is soul relaxing (<a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/observations/2016/01/marie-kondo-more-tidying-guru-she-has-perfected-radical-theory" data-href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/observations/2016/01/marie-kondo-more-tidying-guru-she-has-perfected-radical-theory" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">Marie Kondo</a> anyone?). It gives me joy.

Yes, when you need to rest you need to; neither is it wise to carry a debt of time with your kids, your spouse or close relations. But that does not mean that you skew more to life than work. Life is work. You cannot run from that; embrace it and enjoy.</p><h4 name="bb89" id="bb89" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Trained for the Job or Training on the Job</h4><p name="f6e6" id="f6e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">As I started my job I asked <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.lang.c++/IEirNOw_pDo/Tmb2VC69jlUJ" data-href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.lang.c++/IEirNOw_pDo/Tmb2VC69jlUJ" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">this question</a> in Google groups — <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Do you have to be a good mechanic to be a good race car driver?</em> I thought at that time the question was very deep and poignant. If you are not me, it may look a strange analogy, maybe even silly if you start thinking critically about it. I wrote that with intense feeling at that time, after getting rejected again and again in various programming job interviews at the beginning of my career. All were asking me language details and internals, and I have a problem there -memory-pretty bad memory.</p><p name="8f6f" id="8f6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I remember things, but forget things too; I have very good long term memory, not that good short term — I am not sure how to put it -I remember the essence of things; for the rest, I figure out on the go. I don’t remember ‘interview questions’. I started off as s C++ programmer. Virtual functions, polymorphism .. I don’t remember the rest of the standard questions. So most interviewers rejected me. After a couple, it really starts hurting. You feel sad that no one is able to see your point. Rejection hurts always. Surprisingly very few asked about my work. I was a pretty good programmer then, though I was very less experienced. Come to think of it, I understand better now, experience has nothing to do with how good you are. Especially true of big companies.</p><p name="7a5b" id="7a5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the best person I took after interviewing (that was years hence) failed in my standard interview questions (yes I ask some of these questions- just to filter out the ‘unwashed’ as Joel Spolsky <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30/" data-href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">puts it</a>) -he was sure that I would not select and was going to pack up. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Truth is I never care whether the answer is wrong or right; an interview is not a quiz</strong>.

I basically ask and listen about how they did their work, even college projects for freshers and that tells a great deal. Sure I have taken in not that great people also. But the ratio is less.</p><p name="79eb" id="79eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And lest you think the StackOverflow/Google search programmers like me are among Joel’s ‘unwashed/un-interested/blue-collar programmer’, you may be right, if you are a person like Linus T or some other amongst those few super-hero /<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ&amp;t=0s&amp;index=251&amp;list=LLszXXnROiZXkmg1b5YsPKWA" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ&amp;t=0s&amp;index=251&amp;list=LLszXXnROiZXkmg1b5YsPKWA" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">genius programmer</a>/language creators.

I know there are some posts that argue that static typing does not help in any way, even though general reports are there how it has reduced bugs in companies. I won’t argue with those. I won’t argue with any for these matters. But my opinion stands, and I do code in dynamically typed languages and use that in production too, but keep it to the minimum and always with proper test cases -TDD.</p><p name="ff98" id="ff98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">C++ has no strong abstractions, so it does not leak through; however, you have to however forever swim through it or you drown.
