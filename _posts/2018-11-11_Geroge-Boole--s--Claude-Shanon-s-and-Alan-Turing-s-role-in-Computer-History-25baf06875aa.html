So I thought I will dig deep and write this note for myself, and it may be useful to others as well. Also as I started writing this, it seemed to link with the evolution of AI, as AI as a field started very early, we can say, heavily influenced by the possibility of programmable logic , that is with Claude Shannon’s paper - that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Intelligence </em>is something that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">could</em> be defined by<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> logical rules,</em> and if so it could be implemented by computers. Though we have advanced a lot in efficiency from earlier computers or computing machines, we are as far away from an intelligent machine now, as then, in those early days, when it looked tantalizingly near. When geniuses like Alan Turing thought and wrote about ‘thinking machines’, and created the Turing test as a test for intelligence. I guess this then is the problem of AI as a field, that it captures the public imagination periodically and then lets it down. But this note is not for AI, but just a refresher walk into the past.</p><h4 name="1748" id="1748" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The first step — Mathematical formulation of Logic</h4><p name="f04e" id="f04e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">We don’t need to go as back as the first mechanical computer <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?DifferenceEngine" data-href="http://wiki.c2.com/?DifferenceEngine" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Difference Engine</a> of Charles Babbage, or the punch card-based stored operations driven <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html" data-href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Analytical Engine</a>.

(source wikipedia)</blockquote><blockquote name="b4eb" id="b4eb" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--blockquote">“After graduating in 1936, Shannon went directly to MIT to take up a work-study position he had seen advertised on a postcard tacked to a campus bulletin board. He was to spend half his time pursuing a master’s degree in electrical engineering and the other half working as a laboratory assistant for computer pioneer Vannevar Bush, MIT’s vice president and dean of engineering. Bush gave Shannon responsibility for the Differential Analyzer, an elaborate system of gears, pulleys and rods that took up most of a large room-and that was arguably the mightiest computing machine on the planet at the time…</blockquote><blockquote name="c79f" id="c79f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Conceived by Bush and his students in the late 1920s, and completed in 1931, the Differential Analyzer was an analog computer. It didn’t represent mathematical variables with ones and zeroes, as digital computers do, but by a continuous range of values: the physical rotation of the rods. Shannon’s job was to help visiting scientists “<strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">program</strong>” their problems on the analyzer by rearranging the mechanical linkages between the rods so that their motions would correspond to the appropriate mathematical equations.</blockquote><blockquote name="7a0d" id="7a0d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Shannon was especially drawn to the analyzer’s wonderfully complicated control circuit, which consisted of about a hundred “relays”-switches that could be automatically opened and closed by an electromagnet. <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">But what particularly intrigued him was how closely the relays’ operation resembled the workings of symbolic logic, a subject he had just studied during his senior year at Michigan. Each switch was either closed or open-a choice that corresponded exactly to the binary choice in logic, where a statement was either true or false. </strong>Moreover, Shannon quickly realized that switches combined in circuits could carry out standard operations of symbolic logic. The analogy apparently had never been recognized before. So Shannon made it the subject of his master’s thesis -“A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits,”</blockquote><blockquote name="fadb" id="fadb" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">… toward the end, for example, Shannon pointed out that the logical values true and false could equally well be denoted by the numerical digits 1 and 0. This reali-zation meant that the relays could perform the then arcane operations of binary arithmetic. <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Thus, Shannon wrote, “it is possible to perform complex mathematical operations by means of relay circuits.</strong>” As an illustration, Shannon showed the design of a circuit that could add binary numbers.</blockquote><blockquote name="fc98" id="fc98" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Even more importantly, <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Shannon realized that such a circuit could also make comparisons. He saw the possibility of a device that could take alternative courses of action according to circumstances-as in, “if the number X equals the number Y, then do operation A.” Shannon gave a simple illustration of this possibility in his thesis by showing how relay switches could be arranged to produce a lock that opened if and only if a series of buttons was pressed in the proper order.</strong></blockquote><blockquote name="1ce4" id="1ce4" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong">The implications were profound: a switching circuit could decide-an ability that had once seemed unique to living beings</strong>.</blockquote><p name="5f90" id="5f90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Source -<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/401112/claude-shannon-reluctant-father-of-the-digital-age/" data-href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/401112/claude-shannon-reluctant-father-of-the-digital-age/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">https://www.technologyreview.com/s/401112/claude-shannon-reluctant-father-of-the-digital-age/</a>).</p><p name="f59e" id="f59e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Shannon found that one could directly translate a system of equations of propositional logic into a physical circuit of relay switches, through a rote procedure. </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“In fact,” he concluded, “any operation that can be completely described in a finite number of steps using the words if, or, and, etc. can be done automatically with relays.” — </em></strong><a href="https://technicshistory.wordpress.com/2017/05/10/lost-generation-the-relay-computers/#fn-6571-12" data-href="https://technicshistory.wordpress.com/2017/05/10/lost-generation-the-relay-computers/#fn-6571-12" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">https://technicshistory.wordpress.com/2017/05/10/lost-generation-the-relay-computers/#fn-6571-12</a></p><p name="be17" id="be17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Shannon’s work was used widely in the relay based telephone exchanges and railway track selection relay circuits.</p><h4 name="c1f5" id="c1f5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Role of Alan Turing</strong></h4><p name="dcf6" id="dcf6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">In contrast to Shannon’s paper,<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> Alan Turing’s paper</strong> ( “<a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf" data-href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">On Computable Numbers, With an Application to the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Entscheidungsproblem</em></a> 1936)is highly technical.
