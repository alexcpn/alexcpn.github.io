Bull shit all along.</p><p name="efae" id="efae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That Said</p><p name="049c" id="049c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I love your writing and it makes sense in a lot of ways.</p><p name="be1a" id="be1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What you may have meant is to shine the light on Boeing management. Show me a set of managers who can take proper engineering decisions, that is another magical species. I have put my job on the line fighting for quality many times, telling to the face of powerful mangers that 100% coverage does not mean the code is fully tested; any fool can mock and get the numbers and it does not mean a thing.</p><p name="c8f1" id="c8f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Quality People == Quality Output</p><p name="3b66" id="3b66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Quality People == Never Compromise.</p><p name="b83c" id="b83c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like a good soldier, better to die rather than run, if that is what it means to win.</p><p name="c91e" id="c91e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many writers have a Bias that comes in and predates. It goes like this, you hear about a lot of fake Sadhus, you think everyone is fake. You hear a lot of immigrants creating trouble, you think all immigrants are trouble. Basically, it is human clanship in the subconscious working to demarcate the tribe boundaries. I do it too. I sometimes wish I was blind; I would have judged less and seen better.</p><p name="8ad3" id="8ad3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Having worked with engineers from India, Germany, US, China, Portugal, Finland and Hungary at the code level in my 16 or 17 years as an SW developer. I have seen very few goods,some bad and averages everywhere.</p><p name="8dae" id="8dae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Very few people like Programming for what it is, something creative something fun, something to master however bad you are at it. Many treat it as a Job. I think more than pay or where you are from, or which institution you are from, that is the difference.</p><p name="d37d" id="d37d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And speaking about management, I agree it scares me. The business has no idea where to focus. If you tell them, sorry you need to do these non-functional requirements first and sorry you won&#39;t have anything tangible from this, they do not understand, and the many job warriors will not fight; they will code away to the dictate. I think management is the one that needs to be educated first and if this article was for that, it makes a lot of sense.</p><p name="c549" id="c549" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Also, agree that in some countries more people are duds than others; could be that economic factors drive people to take jobs they don&#39;t like. The moment we demarcate and take advantage of the vulnerable we are lowering ourselves at many levels. Better to help.</p></div></div></section>
