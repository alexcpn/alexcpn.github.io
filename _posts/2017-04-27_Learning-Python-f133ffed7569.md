### Learning Python

Anyone can Cook; Anyone can Program. Learning a Programming Language is
easy, but there is a way to Mastery, and there are no shortcuts there.
However, with the information on the internet and sites like
StackOverflow, it is easier to learn at your pace.

But what will you learn? I never learn for the sake of learning.

I get some problem and I need to solve it and I learn, look up and do.
Here is the path I took in my two years in this language.

And if you are really not sure where to start, the problem is that you
don’t have a problem to solve.

Maybe start off with a simple command line shopping cart, to understand
about DataTypes and Data Structures and IO libraries and Control
Structures. Once you know this, then you know the language.

Algorithms are next and they are language agnostic; I have the memory of
a gold fish; I wrote
[this](https://gist.github.com/alexcpn/1f187f2114976e748f4d3ad38dea17e8)
nearest neighbour finding algorithm using a custom Data-structure (built
from more primitive Data Structure). If you have a problem to solve, and
access to Google and enough motivation to solve it, almost anyone can do
it.

Maybe improving the efficiency of execution is next. Why not do parallel
execution. Thread’s — heard about that; now you do; Google and find out.
Learning how to get information via Internet search is a skill in
itself. I fire usually about a hundred or more search requests in usual
working day. Slowly you learn that skill.

Have you looked up Threads and search came up with Python GIL
limitation; maybe you have rushed off to multi-processing; have you
missed the fibers
/[greenlets](https://greenlet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and gevents
wrapper that makes it so
[simple](https://gist.github.com/alexcpn/48bcf43ac6d7c98f053d) to use.

Good luck on your journey
