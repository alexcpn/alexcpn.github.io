There are some metrics like <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Technical Debt </em>that try to make this visible. In reality a lot of things in building a SW product cannot be easily measured.</p><p name="bd03" id="bd03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before we jump into the risk and safety practices, a little thought on why there is so less thought or attention given to this and other aspects of SW Development. Why are not the best educational institutions in the world not teaching about what to take care during commercial SW development than teaching Pascal or now Java programming or Object Oriented programming.</p><h4 name="eb82" id="eb82" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Business Goal and SW Quality</h4><p name="1e8a" id="1e8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The business goal is to get a product out fast with the minimum resources. The best written and the worst written product looks the same. Some amount of defects are acceptable, most business managers have very limited experience in SW development or releasing a successful product and maintaining it. By the time most of the defects of a released SW product is contained and customer goodwill that is lost is gained back, a lot of heads in the management side usually rolls. They are fired or sidelined because of the pain and cost that it has cost to the business.</p><p name="1c7c" id="1c7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A new and inexperienced set takes over usually for a new product.The cycle continues. This is not a funny thing. In a decade and a half as a programmer I have seen this happen so many times.This will happen again; someone has to take the blame eventually. Meanwhile business will clutch at any straw to save itself from drowning- Agile, Scrum , Lean, Incremental release , Continuous Release ... These can help, but the problem is always people first, what are the people motivated to do? What kind of people do you have?How are the goals and organisations structure set-up? Has the organisation changed to serve itself than the world ?</p><h4 name="c7d2" id="c7d2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Personal Goals and SW Quality</h4><p name="9e06" id="9e06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Why do most people not think about things that are not immediate ? Human behaviour and thought is predominantly reactive ? There is very less retrospection other than that forced by pain (of failure or similar). When we choke with smog and our kids struggle to breathe,we bring in new laws. Unless the pain of not changing becomes intolerable, people rarely change. SW programmers , managers and all others are people. Nobody obsesses over something usually unless they have burned their fingers once. SW Quality is not pursued; just sufficient to scrape through is usually the unwritten target for everyone.</p><h4 name="e2f5" id="e2f5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">The cost of Poor Quality</strong></h4><p name="dcd6" id="dcd6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I don’t think I need to write about the quality aspect of Toyota here. It has made the company the largest in the world. Almost all other car manufacture’s ape its practices (The Toyota Way) and have profited by it. Quality is profitable, in the long run. It is more than profit and loss. It adds a value to the brand that is priceless. Nokia phones anybody ? or Google Photos or Search or Linux.</p><h4 name="bc8b" id="bc8b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Quality does not Come Free</strong></h4><p name="0d7c" id="0d7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Those who obsess about quality are almost always different from the rest. If there is one book that speaks more about it, it is the book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. One does not have to <a href="https://medium.com/tall-west/no-cutting-corners-on-the-iphone-x-97a9413b94e" data-href="https://medium.com/tall-west/no-cutting-corners-on-the-iphone-x-97a9413b94e" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">obsess</a> over it,as to reach the zenith is almost impossible.</p><p name="d918" id="d918" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But there is still much in Quality that makes good long term business sense. Everyone knows this. Everyone pays lips service to this. But then there is a cost to this; and for a company under pressure, it takes a lot of leadership courage to hold on to this.</p><h4 name="2882" id="2882" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Product Delivery Process based on Quality First Principle</h4><p name="6137" id="6137" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">It is time to re imagine organisational structure that incentivize product quality over delivery quantity.</em></p><p name="0191" id="0191" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This may look counter intuitive. In the book that describes the Toyota Production System-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Toyota_Way" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Toyota_Way" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Toyota Way</a>, they talk about how workers were incentivized to stop the production belt if they found some problem. Stopping a production chain in spite of targets is very counter intuitive. However till the root cause is analysed and either fixed if it was major or noted to be fixed later they did not move the belt. In essence they were forcing continuous improvement. For a car production company to slow down production means to take a near term hit in the number of cars produced and profitability.</p><p name="a5e8" id="a5e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">You may need to go slow first to go fast with quality.</em></p><p name="11c7" id="11c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Business need to empower the SW developers and their leads and managers to bring out quality first and product second</strong>.</p><p name="1cb4" id="1cb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If the business is not aligned to this, and accepts this for the long term good,no other process will work.At the best there will be lot of faking and acting that goes along. For startups the long term aspect does no hold much value. But there is something endearing in a good SW product that wins customers. The secret sauce is quality and it holds a pretty good value even to those companies which think short term.</p><h4 name="122f" id="122f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The role of the Technical Lead or Architect in SW Quality</h4><p name="9f27" id="9f27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">There are lot of approaches to SW development and people fight over which is better; for example the type wars — Dynamic Typing versus Static Typing and so on. Usually the practices and technology depends on the context.

Some parts are interesting</p><blockquote name="3fe5" id="3fe5" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Just as in real-world politics, software conservatism and liberalism are radically different world views. Make no mistake: they are at odds. They have opposing value systems, priorities, core beliefs and motivations. These value systems clash at design time, at implementation time, at diagnostic time, at recovery time.</blockquote><blockquote name="7f4e" id="7f4e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--blockquote">“We regard political conservatism as an ideological belief system that is significantly (but not completely) related to motivational concerns having to do with the psychological management of uncertainty and fear.”</blockquote><blockquote name="23a8" id="23a8" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Conservatism, at its heart, is really about risk management.</strong></blockquote><p name="1035" id="1035" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">I hit upon Steve’s article while searching for this article.Most of what he writes about is based on this perceptive. However what I felt was missing in the article is, the context.</p><p name="d690" id="d690" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">A SW Engineering architect has to play both the roles -conservative as well as liberal.</em></strong></p><h4 name="1955" id="1955" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">SW Practises and Quality First Thinking</h4><p name="50f7" id="50f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">It is extremely hard to change how the world thinks.The truth is that the world rarely thinks. The world just believes. And that world has the most educated to the least and everything in between. For anything that does not have strong scientific cause and effect known yet, the world will believe what the world believes.</p><p name="9965" id="9965" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The world may be right, it may be wrong, however that is not the point, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the point is that most of the world never even considers it remotely possible that it can be wrong.</em></strong></p><p name="1c46" id="1c46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have seen newly converted Agile believers fervently playing ‘planning poker’ with poker cards; companies spending millions on ‘Agile trainers’ to teach people how to play this game; the nonsense of putting stick-it notes on white boards and running after those post-its when it flies off or some other practise. I may have angered someone here; hold on before you comment,I could give much better examples; but I believe in writing non dangerously for myself; so I am sticking with hurting a few agile believers ( I am also one, it is sometimes good to think if all the rituals we do in the pursuit of an idea is correct); I will leave it for the world to ponder. I am a conservative in writing though a liberal at heart.</p><p name="e3eb" id="e3eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In his article Steve paints people into mostly two colours, liberals who embrace dynamic typing and not being afraid of bugs and Conservative who shudder at the thought of bugs and will embrace static typed languages. What he misses is the context; why you need to be Liberal sometimes and Conservative at other times.</p><p name="1e68" id="1e68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Brave like a lion, gentle like a lamb..</em></p><h4 name="aca8" id="aca8" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">SW Quality and the Passionate Programmer</h4><p name="53ae" id="53ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">For some, a job is a fulfilment of a part of life, for many others it is a business relation. Both are fine; sometimes you find same people morphing into one or the other based on external factors like time, age, project or a bad day at home or a bad patch.</p><p name="71d9" id="71d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like every field or organisation on earth,SW development needs both these people.</p><p name="ecc1" id="ecc1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For inspired SW developers every language is beautiful in a way.

This is why most business want to be in the start-up sweet spot.</p><p name="b4f5" id="b4f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For a least inspired SW developer, who has no passion towards work, but one among the millions,being a SW liberal Tech Lead and not checking or enforcing unit tests and other code safety rules is being insanely stupid.You will get the worst quality and technical debt in no time.</p><h4 name="382b" id="382b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Grooming better Leaders in SW industry</h4><p name="9b5f" id="9b5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The SW business is currently structured that there is very less emphasis on technical excellence. Business does not know the value of code structuring. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The emphasis is on producing things fast as they are not able to see the presence or absence of Quality till pretty late.</em></p><p name="0df2" id="0df2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">People align very fast to what is expected out of them.</p><p name="4435" id="4435" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">A big company can get infected pretty fast with the wrong expectation propagated everywhere.</em></p><p name="4951" id="4951" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The few who see beyond are thought to be either odd or rebellious or stupid or conservative or some other label. The best of them leave, the others stop caring after sometime.</p><p name="4940" id="4940" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Leads and leaders tend to align with business expectation thinking that those higher up will surely know better. There are very few leaders ready to walk and talk with the crowds or put their ear to the ground. This has to change. We need leaders who understand the work and workers deeply; who are aligned with SW quality.</p><h4 name="c77e" id="c77e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Summary</h4><p name="2998" id="2998" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">It is best to summarise with a exaggerated plot.</p><p name="5d1f" id="5d1f" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--p"><span class="graf-dropCap">T</span><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">he plot begins with a dilemma. The business needs the product as fast a possible. The inspired few has to direct the work of a lot of commercial programmers. The business tells him product quality matters a lot. He tells that product quality is related very much to code quality and related like design decision and external library decisions. However all the business hears is blah-blah-blah. However they trust the person and ask him/her to do what he/she has to do. This seems like a happy scenario, however the truth is that this happiness is short lived.</em></p><p name="953c" id="953c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Days pass to months; the business get’s no features, no product yet.
