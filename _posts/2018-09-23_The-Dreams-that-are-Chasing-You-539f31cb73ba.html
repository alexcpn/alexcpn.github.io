The right partner, doing the thing you like, the right way for your kids, the meaning in your life. A dream does not end when you realize it, it just starts. It takes more work to keep a dream going till the end.</p><p name="312d" id="312d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is nothing like a small dream or a big one; the one that seems the most trivial can be sometimes the hardest for one.</p><p name="a790" id="a790" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is for all those who are starting out and those that are on the way; that it is usually is not as straightforward as you think it is. You will gain it and then lose it and find something truer than the one you thought. Work hard and you will you achieve it? No, not the dream; you can wear yourself with work or thought or hope of prayer; it may elude you for a long time.</p><p name="68d2" id="68d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sometimes, when you really feel that you have completely irreversibly lost it; if you are still true to your dream, it will come. This is because you have to risk it all to chase your dream; and that you will. That’s the nature of dreams, it takes faith to hold on when everything tells you to give up.</p><p name="87b8" id="87b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I won’t call it with such base words as success or failures; a dream is a journey with no destination; realizing it is hard enough but worth the effort; but that is just the beginning of the journey; it is harder to keep it. A dream is a concept, part fantasy; it is up to you to shape the clay of chance and breathe your dream into it. God helps.</p><p name="871f" id="871f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have chased a few; mostly trivial and ordinary to the world; but sometimes the things that seem the least are the greatest. Here is what I learned.</p><p name="6ca0" id="6ca0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You will get what you Dream; everyone will get what they Dream; it is almost like inevitable; many are afraid to dream; they feel they don’t want to lose. The biggest thing you lose is your chance in this world to dream; If you lose it, it may hurt; if you gain it; it will give you peace; and you will gain it if you wish hard enough.</p><p name="eb9b" id="eb9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I can just write one famous line and it will sum up all the volumes ever written in this world —<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.</em></p><p name="55d1" id="55d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is pretty hard to really know what you really want. Do you really want the Nobel Prize or make a difference. Do you really want to feed your ego or feed others? It is never a dream to get the Nobel prize; it may come to you, but your path is different; your search is for the truth; you discard all that is thought of as true; the world thinks you a fool, a stupid rebel; you die unknown sometimes; but if your heart is at peace; that the path you have taken was true to your self; then that is a great dream that achieved. The nature of dreams is strange. There is no success or failure; with all the outwardly success you may still feel hollow; other than the inmost you; there is no way to measure.</p><p name="c888" id="c888" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That seems stupid, right? You may think, I am certain of what I want; my dream is to drive around in a XXW car, marry a x,y,z (add any number of your favorite adjectives here) person, get admission to ZZT college, get that particular person to love me; etc. Is it not pretty clear to me what I want? It seems so, but is it really?</p><p name="f0ed" id="f0ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You can imagine yourself riding in a high-end car, or traveling the world or walking on the moon; or marrying a particular person; that’s a vision to align you. There is nothing wrong with wishes, but you may be driving finally in some other car, married to someone whom you never thought of; doing something you rarely imagined. But your path have led you to the truer things. It is very hard to know exactly what you want; your heart will realize when you have achieved it. The key is that you need to have the right intentions, walk the right path, and never compromise. Then you will be led, as if by magic, to what you really wanted.</p><p name="8afc" id="8afc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The immediate wishes all fade; what is got easily is never valued and is lost as easily.</p><p name="970d" id="970d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your immediate self thinks that selecting based on some adjectives or other criteria that you are aware of. But the inner-self has the real dream; and outer self gets a wish list to deal with, based on what your eyes have seen and mind has thought till then.</p><p name="7ad0" id="7ad0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For the inner self, dreams are always a path to a more peaceful place, a more loving place, a happy place to rest. For the outer self, it is a chase, a conquest, a challenge.</p><p name="373a" id="373a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many don’t really know what they want. Many many many I have seen. The easiest example and the most plentiful is the ‘dream to be successful’, or to distill it further, dream to be rich, or powerful, or dream of a career in something that one has the least interest in, but looks great socially. These are not the dreams of your inner self. But of your outer self, your immediate consciousness.</p><p name="2256" id="2256" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">People get rich and rich and more and more unhappy; people work harder and harder and die early. People play all plots to be powerful and get shot or live in fear. For some nothing dramatic happens, they become rich, they get titles, they get powerful, they control economies, people but live with some hollow feeling inside. No, it is not a mid-life crisis; it is always a crisis.</p><p name="1aad" id="1aad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Material things rarely sustain joy for long; I am a gadget freak and I get sick of myself most of the time.No I am not toting the line of living like a saint; I like the good things in life as much as any other, but I will never ever call it my dream. I will not sell my soul for such a cheap price as outwardly success or socially acceptable success. If I gain that, it is good, one fight less; but it does not affect my inner self.</p><p name="10cc" id="10cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here is another strange thing about a Dream. Love is a Dream to many; but how are you really sure that the person you think is the One, is really the One? And what if you fail in winning the heart of the person you most wish for?</p><p name="e928" id="e928" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here is the strange thing, if you have a dream that is strong enough and live by principles, then your failures are just directing you to your true destiny; when you feel everything is lost; when you feel there is no hope ; when you feel exhausted and tired, when all your outer instincts are telling you to give up, if you still are able to hold on for some more time, to search for some more, to walk the last few miles, you will find it. This is not a cliche; this is not a motivation prose; I am a bad writer, but this is the truth. I see too many give up too fast, or choose an easier way out. I want to shout this out; don’t give up; don’t you see, the journey really is the destination.</p><p name="2d18" id="2d18" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your dream is never ever usually the one your outer self see’s. I know this is true, in my life so far; and I thought I would write this; as I believe some may search and find this.</p><p name="1dbd" id="1dbd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Have you read The Alchemist -the strange way a dream takes one; life is much much stranger than movies sometimes; every dreamer knows this; the real dream is really really hard to get; life feels worth living, with dreams, the more impossible or hard, the better.</p><figure name="f455" id="f455" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 470px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 67.10000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*ricC_bEQ622aljrr.jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="939" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ricC_bEQ622aljrr.jpg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">source <a href="https://jooinn.com/romantic-couple-watching-the-stars.html" data-href="https://jooinn.com/romantic-couple-watching-the-stars.html" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://jooinn.com/romantic-couple-watching-the-stars.html</a></figcaption></figure></div></div></section>
