I learned this recently. Basically I am a person of the 70’s ;not so ancient, we are the ones who have been at the dawn of the digital world. We/Gen X have lived in a world without cell phones and internet and saw their wide popularity and growth when we were teens.</p><p name="6a27" id="6a27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And yes it was the age where nothing was impossible, the spontaneous break up of the USSR, the TV shots of breaking the Berlin wall; and who can forget, watching real time the Iraqi night sky, lit up with anti-aircraft fire, the missile to missile fights, the Patriots against the ‘Scuds’…</p><p name="9cb4" id="9cb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The world was awakening to electronic music/synth-pop, the age of BoneyM and Abba,Modern Talking,Phil Colins, MJ, Stevie Wonder and closer to home A.R Rahman , Yanni and many more..

That I gifted my Mum on her birthday; it was after I got my first job. I used it myself for some time, though the number she still uses.</p><figure name="6501" id="6501" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 700px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 100%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*vlktYYsmhlQ9qsgh.jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="1400" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*vlktYYsmhlQ9qsgh.jpg"></div></figure><p name="d727" id="d727" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Was she surprised to hear the Ringtone and her birthday gift vibrating. It was heavy, but it lasted more years than I remember.You expected thing to last when you pay good money for it.</p><p name="25d0" id="25d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I moved out of my house and for myself I got another Nokia phone Nokia 3610.

I guess it will still work with the old battery; if I could only find the charger. How thrilled was to get SMS at that time; and since SMS was charged, only meaningful messages were exchanged. I wish WhatsApp would start charging.</p><p name="c66a" id="c66a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After this was camera phones, Nokia N series and the complexities and then the iPhone and lo the touch phone revolution along with Android phones, and Nokia phones disappeared. (I don’t dislike iPhone, but I hated the iTunes SW — yes I had the iPods, and did not want to do anything with the restrictive Apple OS)</p><p name="9194" id="9194" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Android was Open Source. I make a living writing and designing SW. Open Source is the ultimate virtual utopia, a land without borders, or currency, where everyone works for the others and everything is free and there is more and more of it.</p><p name="1ceb" id="1ceb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now I have this.

I guess this ‘anti-fragility’ (thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nassem Nicolas Taleb</a>) and anti -complexity is what my heart desires now.</p><p name="41fb" id="41fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All these new phones die soon with SW upgrades; my one year relatively expensive Moto Z struggles to last till evening. I hate this feeling to be chained to chargers or battery packs. This lack of robustness, quality.</p><p name="1c4e" id="1c4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hate the ever bigger screens that does not fit my pockets and occupies my one hand; the constant fear of misplacing or dropping it.</p><p name="6bac" id="6bac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am sick of this.</p><p name="8af0" id="8af0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I used to have a small collection of cassette tapes and that was all the songs I loved and all the songs I enjoyed. Then came CD and then the MP3 and it was my dream come true; at least it seemed so. But the huge choices have made me eternally discontent. I long so much for that world where tapes were expensive and you learned to love what you have dreamed saved and bought</p><figure name="15e5" id="15e5" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 551px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 78.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*zOQDrJ8TDzuh5zOz" data-width="1068" data-height="840" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*zOQDrJ8TDzuh5zOz"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">some of my loved tapes</figcaption></figure><p name="0578" id="0578" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I am sick browsing and hearing all the hundreds of mostly junk and sometimes explicit songs to find that few great ones; most of the time I rarely enjoy; and most of the time I keep listening to the auto generated playlist of the different music apps , always in search for that golden tune.</p><p name="08e8" id="08e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe this defines it most; my Moto Z Play is dying on me; I am sick and tired searching for a new phone every year; the whole purpose of a phone seems to be to search for new phones ; or spent hours addicted to browse useless reviews on YouTube.</p><p name="bc86" id="bc86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let me take it further. I have stayed away from Facebook and Orkut as I struggle just maintaining current social relationship, to keep tenons ghost of the past alive. But I have fallen for WhatsApp. It was almost inevitable. My carpenter started sending pictures in it. How could I not acknowledge such wide spread use. But that’s fine; till WhatsApp group came along and ruined everything.</p><p name="1e33" id="1e33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am sick of WhatsApp; and Twitter; and online comments, and the hate and stupidity and narrow mindedness of the online people that is thrown at your face; of a people who seem to deteriorate in rational thought and maybe intelligence, but more than ever in decency.</p><p name="7d37" id="7d37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am need of a new phone; I am in need always for something or the other.I understand the feeling of this digital addiction.

I want to escape this.</p><p name="5cf9" id="5cf9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I miss my old Nokia so much; or maybe that brief time where technology and Google was there; but limited.</p><p name="0bfe" id="0bfe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I need a new phone; or maybe a new me, where I learn to be content with what I have, not to get distracted by choices.</p><p name="2227" id="2227" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I need to live in a new world where I learn to stay away , far away from the digital garbage and junk and walk on the pristine shores of an ideal,an ideal I yet don’t know what..</p><p name="f055" id="f055" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Maybe use my time and money for better use..</p></div></div></section><section name="fcc1" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="6ace" id="6ace" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Find a cause- <a href="https://milaap.org/" data-href="https://milaap.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://milaap.org/</a></p><p name="0a69" id="0a69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Contribute to flood relief (recent problem in my home town)- <a href="https://donation.cmdrf.kerala.gov.in/" data-href="https://donation.cmdrf.kerala.gov.in/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">https://donation.cmdrf.kerala.gov.in/</a></p><p name="d399" id="d399" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Or help someone <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" data-href="https://stackoverflow.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/</a></p><p name="7ba4" id="7ba4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Or maybe something else, something good, in your home/community/city/ country..</p></div></div></section>
