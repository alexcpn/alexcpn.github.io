## If only I was Blind
-------
If only I was blind
Could I have seen better
Loved better, lived better

Black and White and the Million shades in between
In the light of a radiant smile there is only one 
The colour of love, the words of love

If only I was blind
I could have seen better
Loved better, hurt lesser
Lived better

Oh Joy Joy, you hide under the skin,
You hide from view
Only those who are blind to the world
Can see the heaven in others hearts

Oh if only I was blind
I could have seen better
Loved better
Lived better.
