There are some sensible followers, some ardent followers, and some ardent haters. Interestingly the haters seem to hate the ardent followers/or rather the attitude of the ardent followers more than TDD itself. And that is how hate goes whether it is in SW or anywhere else.</p><p name="c7c3" id="c7c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For me,<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> I use the term to mean write test’s while you write code so that the code is not yet set, but still malleable to be molded to be structured for better testability</em></strong>; and tests for me means automated unit as well as integration tests; not just unit test and coverage number has no meaning for me. The world does not have a better word that TDD; Till then I have to use some acronym and I use TDD now for lack of better; lovers and hater’s don’t burn me yet.</p><p name="05ad" id="05ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the picture in my head when I think of writing tests along with the code; everything is so malleable, it can be shaped to whatever structures you in your mind. You have created something that you wanted, and you have done justice for those who pay you for features, by having something that is testable, refactorable and of good quality.</p><figure name="bbe0" id="bbe0" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*2gtQUsP-BGCZtgQG.jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="683" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*2gtQUsP-BGCZtgQG.jpg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">source <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/myfwcmedia/14709789856" data-href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/myfwcmedia/14709789856" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">https://www.flickr.com/photos/myfwcmedia/14709789856</a></figcaption></figure><p name="79a5" id="79a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Before I dwell more on this, I just want to highlight how I stumbled on this; I want to go back around 15 years. I was a SW developer hired in the company, for C++ programming. There was no Unit test framework for C++ at that time. My job was to add features to existing code base, and that code base was one of the most contrived examples of Object Oriented Programming that I have seen in my life. (Actually, the author could not explain it, he came next day with 7 different sketch colors to draw out the inheritance hierarchy; but that is another story). The company was Siemens Communication Software (now no longer there), and SW was telecom related SW, and we were having a pretty tough customer at that release. The development method was to implement the feature, test it manually and send it to a big testing team for system tests and then for load tests that will run a month or more. Most of the bugs were caught by system testers and SW corrected and delivered again. Before that I was working in another company again in C++ which had fewer testers; it was a small company and SW was for Telephone IVR system, directly interacting with the multi-port telephone cards in PC. A feature was done and shipped by myself/ FTPed to the customer&#39;s machine and installed. There was a time zone gap. If I made a mistake I will be called at midnight or at 2 or 3 AM and will have to go to the office and correct or give a workaround. Because the IVR was used by doctors in hospitals to record their prescription and was kind of important or the product representatives there did not care; it was coding horror at highest, and most of the time I just slept in Office itself during the release times, which was whenever a new feature was asked. Soon I realized that if I wrote <a href="http://www.professionalqa.com/test-driver" data-href="http://www.professionalqa.com/test-driver" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Test Drivers</a>, basically code that calls my code, I could test my software more effectively and the number of bugs decreased to almost null. And since I will be writing tests during coding, my code and design transform itself to test friendly. Soon all the night calls turned out to be some other problem or some other components problem. I left the job as fast as I could, as I got a phobia towards phone rings calling me at night(it was the older landline with the loud ‘tring tring’ sound); but it taught me a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">lesson for life, write your tests while you code so that you leak lesser bugs. </em></strong>So in the new job, I started doing this method and it paid out there also; my features had very less bugs that testers could find. Sometimes none; and it was not because I was a careful coder; it was because I was a careless coder, that I knew that without this I will be in trouble.</p><p name="b8a3" id="b8a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It was during this time that I searched on the internet about testing and found an article about Test Driven Development by a programming methodology called XTreme programming. I wrote a mail to my manager that there is something called TDD and we should practice it in the team.</p></div></div></section><section name="1958" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="c5b6" id="c5b6" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">I guess this is the predominant view by the majority of SW developers; I guess when we talk about TDD, we don’t mean that we write Tests first and code later as Kent Beck defined it in his book. I have actually used Test first when I have no clue on how to start off with some specific work; the last I remember was a tree coloring algorithm. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">But usually, it is writing tests during coding. </em></strong>Sometimes when I have to work on C++, I would start off writing the CMake and test harness/boilerplate setup first, so that I can start writing test cases while I develop.</p><p name="7faa" id="7faa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">However when I say to others that you need to write test during development; I don’t have a better phrase than TDD, and immediately everyone on the floor including the janitor goes stiff and yells -</strong></p><h4 name="056c" id="056c" class="graf graf--h4 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“TDD !!

This is not a science that can be debated; just a persons opinion, at that time, though that person is a very important persons who gave us xUnit type test framework in multiple languages that we use; without which SW quality would have been horrendous and we would have to write code like <a href="https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11" data-href="https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apollo 11 Code</a> with proof that it works</p><p name="d1c0" id="d1c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now let us hear this from <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Kent Beck</strong> himself; Here is a great answer from him; that will leave TDD lovers and haters both bewildered. He says- “<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I am not paid for tests, I write the least amount of tests. I don’t write unnecessary tests”</em></strong>.

They revel in the puzzles posed by the task of debugging. They defend — by appealing to all sorts of supposed Laws of Nature — the right of existence of their program bugs, because they are so attached to them: without the bugs, they feel, programming would no longer be what is used to be!
