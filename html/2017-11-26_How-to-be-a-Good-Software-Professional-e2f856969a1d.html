These are simple habits to acquire, and good to acquire quite early in your journey.</p><p name="3504" id="3504" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then there are aspects like<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">passion, curiosity, creativeness</em><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> </strong>and other such named and unnamed in that realm. These vary widely, and comes from deep desires which have no limited or rational goals like the bounds of a career. Like in life, these define you considerably. It is not effective to write about this, but it is good to know that you need to have some quantities of these, especially to carry on during hard times in your journey.</p><p name="ed54" id="ed54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then there are the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">constraints that one has to live and work with</em>. People are rarely what they seem, at least from my experience; Sometimes the worst mistake you can make is to overlook this aspect in others. Learn to deal with your challenges so that it does not affect your work; be empathetic to others but never to your self.</p><p name="8ad5" id="8ad5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I have split this article into two parts — Personal Techniques and Professional Techniques.</p></div></div></section><section name="daae" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="7e43" id="7e43" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Personal Techniques</h3><h4 name="d3bf" id="d3bf" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">Working Efficiently</h4><p name="24f1" id="24f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I remember attending a speech from a distinguished neurosurgeon long back,and I remember only these few words now— <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Wherever you are, be there.</em></p><p name="6bb8" id="6bb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Distractions of Notifications — </em></strong>To be productive in work you need to concentrate on one task, or a few tasks in a day. It may take an hour or more in the activity to be productive, or even to get started. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Put all type of notifications from all devices to mute, except for your phone. </em>Yes this means emails, instant messaging etc. Every half and hour or so, check and reply to emails, or longer.</p><p name="734f" id="734f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Dealing with Open Office </em></strong>The Open Office concept has both pros and cons.It fosters open communication and it is usually in conversations that new ideas are generated. However sometimes you want to minimize the interruptions that OpenOffice is infamous for; people walking over and chatting nearby, loud phone calls etc. Headphones are a good enough tool, if not for music, at least to flag to people, to know you don’t want to be disturbed.</p><p name="3e1a" id="3e1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Reduce Conference Calls &amp; Meetings </em></strong>Most organisations have lot of recurring meetings that usually have none to negligible value. Reserve time in your calendar daily to do your personal work; the ratio of your time to shared time changes depending on the job role etc; but it is needed to have some time for yourself everyday.</p><p name="25f8" id="25f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Debt of Time </em></strong>— Invest a second in a smile, a minute in a courtesy, an hour with your family, hours improving or learning skills. Don’t spend all your hard earned time in useless talk,social media, online shopping or other distractions. A debt of time, grows and can cripple you faster than you think. You may think you can loan from now and repay tomorrow. That tomorrow never comes. This is same for work as for relationships.Invest in both.</p><h4 name="0eaa" id="0eaa" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Working Effectively</h4><p name="e671" id="e671" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Efficiency usually means doing a lot in a short time. However this is meaningful if balanced with effective work.</p><p name="d845" id="d845" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Plan more to do less </em></strong>As a programmer, the projects in which I have thought more before even writing a single line of code has improved my efficiency considerably. Overcome the urge to execute fast and thereby miss out on some detail that will usually cause lot of rework.Sometimes whole projects with tens of thousands of man hours can be avoided putting just a few more hours up front in thought. People generally like to do, and not to think and niggle and question.</p><p name="3fc3" id="3fc3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The illusion of work- </em></strong>Just doing something that feels like work, to satisfy the inner need of fulfillment, is a lie that you lie to yourself. Live this lie long enough and you will end up believing it and being blind to it. Try to un-busy yourself so that you can take time to retrospect and re-adjust.</p><h4 name="b52c" id="b52c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Differentiate Yourself</h4><p name="b5e3" id="b5e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Give a little More </em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">—</em> Do not live your life as a barter system; give more than what people expect. It is very hard for many including me to do this, though the actual effort is really small. It is just that our sense of fairness is so deep rooted that all behavior tend to route through it. It is not easy to overcome this fully. But work is where this is easy to practice.</p><blockquote name="0b3b" id="0b3b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Once accidentally my rating got shared with me before announcement. I was put down a lot, as it was clear that my manager had under rated me. There was still a month or so for the official communication. However instead of feeling hurt, I worked as if I got the best rating for my work. Strangely later my rating got reversed, though I was not really expecting it. Maybe he had copy pasted an initial draft, it never occurred to me at that time, and if I allowed my sense of fairness to take over, things may have actually turned for worse.</blockquote><p name="3ca4" id="3ca4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Make your Role Redundant-</em></strong> Share your knowledge, share information, Transfer leadership and power. It may sound counter intuitive, but you need to give away to get more. This is true mentoring. If you hoard, you are forever like the proverbial toad, the king in a well.</p><p name="d1b8" id="d1b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Do what you Love</em></strong> — It seems like a cliche. But it is not. Know what you want to do, and start with it. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Do not sacrifice the job you love for the sake of a career that seems glittery or easy to get.</em></strong></p><blockquote name="6fd7" id="6fd7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">When I started out, I wanted to be a programmer,not a tester, not a manager, nothing else, just a programmer. I was not confirmed after a lucrative campus placement that I landed, due to the recession that triggered after the twin tower attack 9/11. Almost like being laid off, after working for some six months.It was a very difficult period to land a job,especially for some with no work experience. Interviews were hard to come by, very hard. I remember getting an interview arranged by college and the company recruiting me as a tester. I said no. College was furious, but someone finally landed it.I then spend the next, one of the most depressing three months of my life, searching for other offers. I understood what it meant to be depressed; the complete lack of desire to get up from bed in the morning; as there is nothing to do, but email your resume. Finally I got to join as a programmer in my hometown; with a pay that is quarter of what I pay my part time maid now. But I wanted so badly to get behind a computer screen and I took it. And I learned a lot there, grew very fast there,and it was a good,though hard start. I hate to write my personal stuff, but I want to illustrate, that these are not cliches. As is written, there are choices to make, and in the end the choices you make , makes you. And things you get hard, you tend to appreciate more.</blockquote><p name="d328" id="d328" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Expand your horizon Read </em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">—</em></p><p name="9d3f" id="9d3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some blogs —</p><ul class="postList"><li name="4782" id="4782" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Current Trends — Reddit Programming</li><li name="a991" id="a991" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Paul Graham — Essays</li><li name="5024" id="5024" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Object Mentor/Uncle Bob — Articles</li><li name="1e46" id="1e46" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Steve Yegge Blog</li><li name="94b7" id="94b7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Night Hacks — James Gosling blog</li></ul><p name="a38a" id="a38a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Some books that I recommend</p><ul class="postList"><li name="d597" id="d597" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">The Magic of Thinking Success — Dr David Schwartz</li><li name="679e" id="679e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The Mythical Man Month</li><li name="1c94" id="1c94" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Zen &amp; The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance ( must read to understand Quality)</li><li name="5aec" id="5aec" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Guns,Germs and Steel — Jared Diamond</li><li name="2038" id="2038" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Man’s Search for Meaning — Victor Frankl</li></ul><h3 name="1a82" id="1a82" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Professional Techniques</h3><p name="5961" id="5961" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Below are some of the professional techniques that I have started following from the beginning of my career. And so would most good programmers for most of the scenarios they are asked to program in.</p><p name="9256" id="9256" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Test Driven Development- </em></strong>My second job was doing maintenance and extensions for a alarm processing component in a telecom management product. I found that if my development flow has the added advantage of the feedback from executing the new and old code via automated tests the errors in my module caught by system verification teams reduced to almost zero. The language was C++ and there was no unit test or other frameworks. So I used to write and use elaborate test drivers and some test stubs to drive test my code. Later learned about Test Driven Development, and the variant Test first development. TDD basically means to me, to write the tests about the same time as you write code, so that tests and code both influence and shape each other. This will mean more effective tests and more testable code and design. This is what I follow usually in development. Test First Development means you write your test case first and then write the code for that, that will make the test case pass. Remember to not be sucked into definition rigour mortis. Remember this is not a religion you have to follow to the word. A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds (Ralph Waldo Emerson). I have found Test first development really useful in shaping algorithms, where I do not know how to start.</p><p name="262a" id="262a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Learn from Bugs — </em></strong>The best lessons you learn are most from mistakes that you see others make or the consequence of yours. This is sad, but it is the truth.It is quite similar regarding bugs. If you have been lucky enough to work with not so stable software systems or buggy products, or bad designs, you learn such a depth of information that you would never get any other way. I was once talking to a candidate in an interview and then this fact hit me; and I smiled and told him, you are not able to answer what I am asking because you were not lucky enough to work in buggy systems, badly engineered systems. So use every bug or anomaly report that comes your way; and persist and persevere till the end. The harder and more elusive a problem the better learning it is.</p><p name="d0da" id="d0da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Learn to Search — </em></strong>While I was studying there were no internet. We had to spend considerable time in book stores to find good technical books. I do remember searching for a month, to make an image transparent for a graphics project and finally finding the key API BitBlt, or its arguments, in a second hand book store near the City Railway station. This was the search pre-internet times. It is easier now, however searching via keywords is a skill. How to filter the chaff out, how to refine the keywords. Don’t be happy with just the first few results that throws up. There is usually a wealth of good information, but most are obscured, or you are misled.</p><p name="7bff" id="7bff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Using a language effectively —</em> </strong>Nobody needs a language expert, but at the same time, if you are working on a language for some time, and not know its strengths, weakness, its quirks (JavaScript anyone) its tools, then you are not really able to use the language effectively and efficiently. Here is an example - you rarely need to use functors in C++; a functor taking multiple parameters can look like a real messy code. But if you have to implement the Command Pattern, it lend itself elegantly.The key here is applied knowledge, the desire to search out the language features that is most apt. Another example is for languages that support co-routines you do not need threads for some implementations; example Greenlets in Python and I guess maybe similar in Go. Good programmers have a knack to find and apply the most apt constructs; bad programmers code is gigantic blobs of if’s and else with spattering of classes here and there.</p><p name="077e" id="077e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Learn a new Programming Language every XX Months/Years</em></strong>. It is kind of sad to interview experienced software developers who just know the ubiquitous Java language. It feels so dumb; when it is trivial to learn and apply some at least JVM based language.</p><p name="033e" id="033e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Learn the Principles behind Paradigms— </em></strong>Just as Love is the pillar behind most religions, there are few principles behind most methodologies like Object Oriented programming. Do not blindly parrot what is written or what is in vogue; question and seek. If you do not seek, you are a mindless follower at best, a fanatic in the worst. The language wars in discussion forums are illustrative. You are a ardent follower of OOP and you have not even heard about Open Closed Principle ? You love the automated garbage collection, but do not know what is it that you sacrifice for that- GIL in Python, GC pauses in Java , and what is it in Go ? You want high availability and consistency and are not aware of CAP theory ? Usually new paradigms sacrifice some parts for better advantages in other parts; you need to be aware of the principles that guide these paradigms as sometimes they may be contrary to your problem domain.</p><p name="913f" id="913f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The best questions you can ask a candidate is not puzzles or language or framework fundamentals, but just questions that have no right or wrong answers.</p><p name="32e4" id="32e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Build up an Online Persona — </em></strong>This is important. I used to put my work online right from college. That was the time of Geo cities and Code Project if someone remembers these still. Then it was usenet groups hosted by Google, that is HTTP access, and then different blogs, Sourceforge and now Git, StackOverflow and tomorrow something else. These things change fast, but people discover you via your work. I have a pretty lousy presence but still I do manage to get some good job requests once in a while. Maybe I landed my current job partly by a college project that I hosted online. More than that, sharing your knowledge when your life and career is indebted form the work open-sourced by others, the enriching articles that you have read freely, I feel is the right thing to do.</p></div></div></section>
