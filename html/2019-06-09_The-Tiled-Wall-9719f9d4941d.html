But it may be comforting to know that there are others in similar pain, and however dark the immediate future looks, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I am writing this as actually, Google search has helped me find the problem I was having and then the cure was relatively straight forward.</p><p name="8202" id="8202" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Winding the clock back to 2003. I had just got a job I dreamed of. Computer programming for telecommunication system provider. Into one or two months into it, I started getting very strange and intensely painful headaches every day at sharp 11 am. I was no stranger to headaches, which used to come once or twice a month. But none as like this, and none with the un-nerving frequency, almost like an alarm clock. It makes you wonder at the not so apparent systems in your body.</p><p name="a480" id="a480" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For some time it was not clear at all whether I was strung up and the headache was induced by my fear or anxiety. But then I ruled it out, and it was a great relief. The moment you cannot trust your mind I feel is the moment when life becomes a confusion, a dread. Google search was pretty mature by that time. I remember searching for different symptoms and thinking all the time initially that it was sinusitis or migraine. This is because as a side effect the nose gets blocked and stuffy and as the headache progresses the eyes get teary and red.</p><p name="73b8" id="73b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many times I visited hospitals. Once I even the ENT was almost convinced that it was sinusitis and since the pain was too much I asked him to clear it via tubes which he did. I used to consult the ENT before and he had for an earlier bout given a powerful nasal spray. At that time it was not periodic and I got it while I was in a park and I thought it could be pollen that was aggravating the sinusitis and since my nose was not straight, many specialists concurred. But this time he was not that convinced and he gave me the reference to a neurologist and asked me to consult there. I did consult there, and the neurologist was thinking that it could be a form of migraine. But I did not have the aura or related symptoms.</p><p name="8086" id="8086" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since I was new at the new job and not that experienced too, I used to work through the headaches. That is when I could manage to sit in my cubicle. There were a not so supportive manager and one teammate. I could not hide it as my eyes were blood shot and tears would flow. But I remember how a kind word would have meant, instead of mildly concealed happiness from a colleague and not so concealed apprehension from the manager that a co-worker that has newly joined was handicapped. A few years hence both were gone, as their mettle was very poor. Only such people try to gain from other’s weakness. From my part, this has given me resolve and I may have taken no more than ten or even less of sick leaves in fifteen years for this. I find this everywhere, those who are weak needs to prove they are strong, and they become strong; those who lose a leg, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/nepal/10072600/Indian-woman-becomes-first-female-amputee-to-climb-Mount-Everest.html" data-href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/nepal/10072600/Indian-woman-becomes-first-female-amputee-to-climb-Mount-Everest.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">climb the Everest</a> and hubris lethargy and decay affect mostly the unchallenged.</p><p name="d37f" id="d37f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I have written, pain is intensely personal. Pain is a feeling. You don&#39;t have to be wounded to feel the pain of a wound. Pain, however, is different from sorrow. You feel sad when you do not get what you wish when a relationship becomes bad etc. Sorrow can lead to depression and danger. But intense pain just wants release.</p><p name="5d0c" id="5d0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To tell that the pain of this headache was intense is the only way to share. The most painful minutes I used to spend in the bathroom of the office, my head against the extremely clean tiles. I thanked in my heart the janitor boys who used to brush each tile joints clean on Saturdays. I saw them once. Could be that I am sensitive to pain. Maybe for others, they could carry on. But I doubt. I remember one bout vividly, it was so intense that I started cursing the day I was born. I remember this vividly as it was not a frivolous thing that one says, but something that came from very depths. Depths I have not felt till then or ever afterward. This is a feeling that cannot be explained; it was a feeling that I wanted to renounce everything up to the moment to be spared of the pain.</p><p name="3965" id="3965" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For many years I used to live in absolute terror, unwilling to even think about the episodes. I turned forty a few years back. I have stopped being afraid of it some years back. That’s one reason I am writing this; that there is hope. And the hope is medication once you get the proper diagnosis.</p><p name="398e" id="398e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cluster headaches are misdiagnosed generally even by the best doctors even in the most developed nations. The clue was the periodicity. I started researching the headaches and the different terms for frequency and sure enough, the symptoms of Cluster headache matched. This was during about after my marriage. I remember going to the very good neurologist and telling him that it was Cluster headache and to give me medicine for that. He looked at me and smiled; maybe he understood the pain I was in. He prescribed a complex set of medicines whose strength had to be gradually increased in I believe two weeks. I thank him for trusting me.</p><p name="0307" id="0307" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was a Sunday. I was taking my son to his first haircut. The time was around 10 am. I could sense the clouds gather of an imminent attack. By this time I could carry on with whatever I was doing, though it was torture. My son was about a year old and he was crying and protesting as the barber was trying to come close. I was with him trying to calm him and also bit afraid and irritated waiting for the lightning to strike and the storm to start. Suddenly as if by magic the clouds cleared, my heartbeat became normal. The pain melted away as if drowned in the tears of my son. The world became open to me once more.</p><p name="04e2" id="04e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not that it has not happened again after that. About two or three times in those fifteen years I got it. Once I was so weak and also staying quite far off that I could not go to the doctor. The hospital was a medical college and always very very crowded, and so was the doctor, very very busy. In that, once I just took his old prescription and followed it.</p><p name="7e03" id="7e03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Slowly I lost my fear of it. In its worst, I refused to be conquered by it. Not that it has not left any scars. I do get periodic headaches on weekends but nothing of that severity. Still, it dampens the mood and the family time at those two days when you are at home; though many times I never tell anyone. I have searched for reasons for years; tried different food as it has some relation to glycemic headache, tried so many diets that my wife reached a brink and I remember pleading with her that this will be the last time I am going to change and to understand. But even those who love you most won’t be able to understand or share your pain. This is not because others are insensitive or are not trying hard; it is because it is impossible for anyone to really share your pain and fears.</p><p name="2484" id="2484" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Did I find a cure for this weekend headaches? No. I have junked the diets. Weekend headaches are a dampener, but usually not that much of a problem. Usually, no one knows. Sternous workouts increase the chance. I run every weekend and recently clocking ten kilometers. I do get a headache, it has become migraine now as a new doctor told me. I can go without a pill; I take half and it goes off in an hour. That won’t stop me from running, actually, that makes me want to run further more.</p><p name="0f5b" id="0f5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So for those of those rare few who got this; don’t worry this is nothing major; the moment you identify what type of headache you are having to a reasonable degree, the cure is at hand for the most intense problems. For minor things, the cure is yourself, try not to surrender. The world is a beautiful place.</p><p name="0fd4" id="0fd4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After recovering about, the world looks so full of beauty and hope, that is just the feeling that your moments are free of that soul wrenching pain, give a sheen to life that cannot be felt by those who are deprived of that simple but essential joy. After one bout I remember watching the space station video on youtube and feeling so elated sharing and writing this is the now defunct Google Plus. It has been years since, I fell that I too have lost that simple joy now, of being alive without pain. Strange how the most intense experiences fade with time.</p><blockquote name="a9d0" id="a9d0" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Awesome; There is some implicit happiness in being alive, that needn’t be pursued, that is there as a solace in all pain; there is a lot of hope and happiness in this knowledge….</blockquote><figure name="d27c" id="d27c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--blockquote"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 579px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 82.69999999999999%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*fkyG2Rnrg7T8wNnkPPR1ow.png" data-width="700" data-height="579" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fkyG2Rnrg7T8wNnkPPR1ow.png"></div></figure><p name="37ba" id="37ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">One another article I came across some time back -</p><p name="3228" id="3228" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><a href="https://medium.com/@martinramirezit/living-with-pain-my-third-cluster-headache-season-7f2528422bac" data-href="https://medium.com/@martinramirezit/living-with-pain-my-third-cluster-headache-season-7f2528422bac" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">https://medium.com/@martinramirezit/living-with-pain-my-third-cluster-headache-season-7f2528422bac</a></p></div></div></section>
